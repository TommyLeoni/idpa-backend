If you’re under the age required to manage your own Google Account, you must have your parent or
legal guardian’s permission to use a Google Account. Please have your parent or legal guardian read
these terms with you.
If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the services, then these terms
apply to you and you’re responsible for your child’s activity on the services.
Some Google services have additional age requirements as described in their service-specific
additional terms and policies.
Your relationship with Google
These terms help define the relationship between you and Google. Broadly speaking, we give you
permission to use our services if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect how Google’s
business works and how we earn money. When we speak of “Google,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” we mean
Google Ireland Limited and its affiliates.
What you can expect from us
Provide a broad range of useful services
We provide a broad range of services that are subject to these terms, including:
apps and sites (like Search and Maps)
platforms (like Google Play)
integrated services (like Maps embedded in other companies’ apps or sites)
devices (like Google Home)
Our services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the
next. For example, Maps can remind you to leave for an appointment that appears in your Google
Calendar.
